# Android Mobile App
## Description:
This is my first android mobile app built in Adnroid Studio. The app has a button and a textview that tells how many times user has clicked the button. The button also appears in a different location when clicked (a small feature I thought is pretty cool to add). You can see most of the work in [MainActivity.java](https://github.com/kimhuanle/ECE387-Mobile-App/blob/main/java/com/example/ece387app/MainActivity.java) and [activity_main.xml](https://github.com/kimhuanle/ECE387-Mobile-App/blob/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml)
